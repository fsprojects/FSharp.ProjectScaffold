# ProjectScaffold

## Getting started

Used to initialialize a prototypical .NET/mono solution including file system layout and tooling.

This includes [Paket](paket-package-management.html) dependency management and a [FAKE](fake-build.html) build process that: 

* allows a simple [one step release process](release-process.html). 
* works with most [build servers](build-servers.html) 
* compiles the application and [runs all test projects](running-tests.html)
* synchronizes all ``AssemblyInfo`` files prior to compilation
* generates [SourceLinks](https://github.com/ctaggart/SourceLink)
* generates [API docs based on XML documentation tags](writing-docs.html#API-docs)
* generates [documentation based on Markdown files](writing-docs.html#Markdown-files)
* generates and/or pushes [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org) packages

### Cloning the project

This first thing to do is to clone or copy the ProjectScaffold repository to your own workspace.

    // in target directory
    git clone https://github.com/fsprojects/ProjectScaffold.git .

### Initializing

In order to start the scaffolding process run:

    $ build.cmd // on windows
    $ build.sh  // on mono

During the init process you will be prompted for the name of your project and some other details including the following:

* Project summary
* Project description
* Author's name for NuGet package
* Tags for NuGet package (separated by spaces)
* GitHub username
* GitHub project name (if different than project name from above)

The project structure will then be generated from templates.

After the initialization you can open, edit, build and test using ``ProjectName.sln``.
